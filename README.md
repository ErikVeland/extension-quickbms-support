#QuickBMS support

QuickBMS is an extractor engine written by Luigi Auriemma that can be programmed
through some simple instructions contained in textual scripts, it's
intended for extracting files and information from the archives of any
software and, moreover, games.

Given its versatility, we can use this application to extract and/or replace files
from within a game's archive - e.g. Resident Evil 2 (2019) and DMC5 which require
us to invalidate game files within the game's archive in order for mod files to be
picked up by the game.

A .bms script must be provided for quickbms to extract/repack correctly.
